# Arkanoid

This is a Java-based implementation of the classic game Arkanoid, developed as part of an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course at Bar-Ilan University.

_**Features**_

- Implemented using core OOP principles such as polymorphism, inheritance, and design patterns.
- Utilizes generic collections and follows solid software design principles.
- Custom GUI implementationâ€”no reliance on Java's built-in GUI components.
- Multiple levels with increasing difficulty.
- Some blocks are darker, indicating a special block that spawns an extra ball when broken.
- Single-threaded game engine.
  
_**Installation**_

To run the game locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RoeiMesi/Arkanoid.git
2. Open the project in an IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Visual Studio.
3. Add the biu-oop.jar file as a global library within your IDE's project settings.
4. Ensure that your project is configured with JDK 10 or higher.
5. Run the project by selecting the main menu and clicking "Play."

_**Playing the Game**_

- Use the 'Left' and 'Right' arrow keys to move the paddle.
- Press 'P' to pause the game.
- Press 'Space' to resume play.
- Break all blocks by hitting them with the ball to advance to the next level.
- Darker blocks are special; breaking one will spawn an extra ball.
- Score points for each block you break (5 points per block) and for completing levels (100 points per level). Try to achieve the highest score!
- **Note**: You only have one life per game, so be cautious!
