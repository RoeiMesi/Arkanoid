# Arkanoid
This is a Java implementation of the classic game Arkanoid, developed as part of an OOP course at Bar-Ilan university.

_**Features**_

Java implementation using the following OOP principles: polymorphism and inheritance, basic design patterns and generic collections.
GUI interface
Contains multiple levels with increasing difficulty.
Coded using a single thread
Does not use built-in Java GUI, instead, it uses a custom GUI implementation which is included in the repository.

_**Installation**_

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/RoeiMesi/Arkanoid.git
Open the project from an IDE such as IntelliJ or Visual Studio.
Add the biu-oop.jar file as a global library to the Arkanoid project.
Make sure an updated JDK is set in the configuration for the menu to run on, and click play!

_**Playing the game**_

Use the 'Left' and 'Right' arrows to control the paddle.
Press 'p' to pause the game.
Press 'Space' to re-enter the game.
Remove all blocks in each level by striking them with the ball.
Every block that you remove grants you 5 points, every level that you pass grants you 100 points. Try to get the highest score!
Note: The game has only 1 life, so use it carefully!
